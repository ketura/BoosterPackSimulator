	+ Explain what the app is
	- Brief explanation of how to use it
	+ Assure that this is a simulation with no real money
	+ link to PC webpages
	+ downloads Json Payload describing all products
		- blocks links until this is loaded into the browser local storage
	- Payload
		- describes each case
		- describes each booster box
		- describes each booster
			- defines set
			- defines card/rarity count
			- defines which algorithm to use (movie, shadows, BR, reflections)
		- describes each card (just an ID to use as a link to find the image)
		~ All of the above done for:
			+ FOTR
			- MOM
			- ROTEL
			- TTT
			- BOHD
			- EOF
			- ROTK
			- SOG
			- RF
			- MD

- Purchase Product
	- Lists all booster products by set
		- Starters worth it?
	+ Permits you to "buy" cases, boxes, or individual packs of product
		+ prices are part of the json payload
- Open Product
	- Displays how many of each type of box you have "purchased".  
		- Sealed cases can be opened for X boxes
		- Sealed boxes can be opened for X boosters
		- Sealed boosters can be opened as described below for X cards
	- boxes should reasonably fake randomization until sheets can be mapped
		- Ensure that rares are never repeated between boosters of the same box
		- Ensure that no cards are repeated within a given booster
	- booster requires tearing open (swipe down or mouse drag)
	- Display cards in a way that requires swipe (or keyboard input/button click) 
	- Bronze/Silver/Gold outline/shine on a new card being added to a collection
	- Display noting that this is the "1st" or "2nd" or "524th" copy
	- Special 
	- audio:
		- unwrapping sound
		- small, unannoying whump for revealing common
		- medium whump for revealing uncommon
		- orchestral hit for revealing rare
		- brief fanfare for revealing common foil
		- medium fanfare for revealing uncommon foil
		- over-the-top fanfare for revealing rare foil
		- fart noise or other failure whomp for revealing no foil
		- enhanced jingles when a card is new to the collection?
- View Collection
	- Show stats of how complete each set is
	- Show pie and bar charts breaking down completion and doubles
	- "binder mode" that lets you browse
	- Total stats of how much money you've "spent" and how much collection : chaff you have
	- Visual representation of how many binders/boxes are required to show everything off?
- Settings
	- booster display order:
		- Decipher Mode (3 uncommons, 1 rare, 1 common/foil, 6 commons)
		- Buildup Mode (5 commons, 3 uncommons, 1 rare, 1 common/foil)
	- flip mode on/off:
		- when on, cards are revealed face-down and must be tapped to flip and then swipe to dismiss
		- when off, card are revealed face-up and must be swiped to dismiss
	- auto mode on/off:
		- when on, boosters are automatically opened and cards automatically swiped, tho at a somewhat sedate pace
	- auto mode speed:
		- when auto mode on, determines whether it goes through "sedate", "quick", or "blazing"
	- export collection
		- Downloads a JSON file of the entire collection/history
	- import collection
		- Takes a JSON file and overwrites the current progress
	~ delete local collection
		- after prompting 2 or 3 times for confirmation, shows a box of cards getting put through an industrial shredder
		+ resets local collection to a fresh state
	- refresh cache
		- forces a redownload of the JSON product definitions
